# SUTSim

SUTSim is a simulation framework for validating baremetal or RTOS-based firmware off-target. Here are the main features:
- Supports signal injection at any layer of the firmware, eliminating hardware dependencies (sensors, data storage, etc.)
- Supports signal monitoring at any layer of the firmware, allowing users to monitor what the firmware is doing at any given timestep
- Supports a Python abstraction for writing automated regression tests that validate system-level behaviour

Take a look at the examples in the repo for more info on the framework's capabilities.
